# Compiler-Design
Codes for different phases of a compiler

# Left-factoring
Program to remove left factoring from a given grammar to make it deterministic and suitable for top down parsers.

# Left-recursion
Program to remove left recursion from a given grammar to make it suitable for top down parsers.

# LL1 Parser
The complete code for a non-recursive predictive parser alongwith error handling which takes as input a string and a grammar and produces the parse tree for that string according to the given grammar.

# Recursive Descent Parser
The complete code for a recursive descent parser made for a specific grammar.

# NFA-to-DFA
Program to a convert a given NFA to DFA.
